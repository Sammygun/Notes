							_Networks and Their Basic Components_

1 apple watch and iphone connection its network 
2 phone wifi network 
3 network uptime 99,999%, 5 minutes in year only down 
4 file sharing, video? striming, youtube   # example network trafic 
5 from one place to another place send data

6 Client # tv, laptop, phone 
  Server # email server, web server 
  Hub # old technology if you talking every one hear you 
  WAP # wireles Access Point 
  Switch # hub but switch(smart hub) can learn with device has a port hub doesnt switch use one port and will send to another one port, hub using when use onet port he send date all ports 
  router # connect two networks together 
  Media # radio, example 
  WAN link # internet example connections to the outside world

_Network Resources_

 Client/Server model we can configure our server and used it 
1 centalized administration
2 easy managment
3 better scalability # масштабируемость 

Peer-to-Peer model (share resources files directly with others)
1 administraion hard, hard backup files nightmare

Benefit
1 who is part of network can share,easy to connect, easy to configure
2 5 pc in office easy to make such model, one pc everybody can get access

Drawbacks
1 but if pc down no one access to it
2 decentalized mangement 
3 poor scalability(масштабируемость)

For facebook better client/server technology 
#######################################################
_Network Geography_
1 Personal Area network(PAN)
 the least amount of area (few meters)
 
bluetooth # example
usb hard disk
everything that i can touch using my nand 

2 Local Area Network(Lan) (small office)
office connects components within a limited distance 
Up to a few hundred feett 

2.1 ethernet (IEEE 802.3)!!! or WIFI (IEEE 802.11)!!!
Home network example 

3 Campus Area Network # CAN
connections in university, industrial park, business park covers many square miles and buildings 
military bases 

diffrent colledges have their own campus map

4 Metropolitan Area Network (Man)
Connects locations a city or media area 
up to 25 miles area or liitle bigger 
MAN example police deparment 

5 Wide Area Network (WAN)
Virtual Private Networks tunneled over the Internet 
across state, world 
internet network exmaple 
WAN can be not public, goverment USA have their small networks example 

Total 
1 PAN (arround personal) # pan bluetooth selphone and ipad
2 LAN (room or Building) # car connect to wifi home network
3 CAN (Campus or Business Park) # 
4 MAN (City or Country)
5 WAN (Country or Worldwide)  # internet car can connect to WAN
